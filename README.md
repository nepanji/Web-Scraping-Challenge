# Web-Scraping-Challenge
This assignment demostrates my ability to build a web application that scrapes various 
websites for related data and display them in a single HTML.

## Step 1: 
#### Build a scrape to retreive the following data:
  * NASA Mars News
  * JPL Mars Space Images
  * Mars Facts
  * Mars Hemispheres

## Step 2: 
#### Create a route 
My Jupyter Notebook was converted into Python script with a function called scrape. All of 
my scraping code returned all of the scraping data into one dictionary and stored in MongoDB. Lastly, 
a route was created to query the MongoDB and passed to the HTML.

## Step 3:
#### Create HTML
An HTML was created to display all of the collected data.
